# Vertical-DO-variance_MATLAB
This repository collects MATLAB code to compute vertical dissolved oxygen variance and its budget terms using ROMS Fennel model outputs.

To use this code, one should have result files of ROMS and biology diagonose files. 

The correct order to run the code is

DOVar.m

O2_prod.m

air_sea_exchange_SOD.m

DOVar_bio_air_sea_SOD_NEM.m
